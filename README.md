Day 1 Reflection
1. create github
2. reflect on what you hope to learn in this program and add it to Responses

I have been always interested in learning machine algorithms and their applications in real world industry. Indeed, I took a course that taught me the mathematical foundation before basic machine learning algorithms, such as why a regularization is considered into a model or bias-variance tradeoff. In addition, I had an internship that utilized AI technology/algorithms to build some future-predicting models. However, I never learned it systematically in terms of implementing ML algorithms (i.e. the engineering side of AI). And I hope that I can gain some hard skills that can be useful for my future career via this program.
